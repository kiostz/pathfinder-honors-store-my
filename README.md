# PEM Pathfinder Store

Honors store for Pathfinder clubs. Static site (React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind) hosted on GitHub Pages at https://kiostz.github.io/pathfinder-honors-store-my/.

## Run locally

Needs Node 24 (see `.nvmrc`).

    npm ci
    npm run dev

Open the address Vite prints. For the production build: `npm run build && npm run preview`, then open http://localhost:4173/pathfinder-honors-store-my/.

## Order form settings

The order form reads two keys from the committed `.env` files, which are public by design:

- `VITE_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY` in `.env` (a placeholder until the order handler's Web3Forms key is pasted in; switching inbox later changes only this line).
- `VITE_HCAPTCHA_SITEKEY`: `.env` holds Web3Forms' shared sitekey for the production build; `.env.development` holds hCaptcha's always-passing test key, because hCaptcha refuses `localhost` with a real key.

To try the whole order flow without a real send, run `npm run dev -- --mode fake-send`: `.env.fake-send` (dev only, never part of the build) makes Send order wait 800 ms, log the email subject and text to the browser console and succeed, with hCaptcha's test key. The order text in that console log holds the buyer's details, so use made-up ones. A real send cannot pass hCaptcha on `localhost`; it is tried once on the live site.

`public/data/clubs.json` is a list of clubs: `name` plus `area`, `language`, `location` and `churchName` (each text or `null`). The seed's `--force` still writes `[]`, which is valid.

## Seed the data

`npm run seed` writes `public/data/honors.json`, `clubs.json` and `settings.json` from `scripts/seed/adventist-honors.csv`. It refuses to overwrite existing files. To overwrite them, run:

    npm run seed -- --force

## Patch pictures

`npm run patches` copies each honor's patch picture from the Pathfinder Wiki into `public/patches/`, sets `image` in `public/data/honors.json` and writes `scripts/patches/import-report.md`. It needs `cwebp` (`brew install webp`). If it ends with failed requests, run it again: it only fetches the honors that still have no picture.

## Test

    npm run lint
    npm run typecheck
    npm test

## Deploy

Deploy by pushing to `main`. The workflow `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs lint, typecheck and tests, then builds, in a build job; a separate deploy job publishes to Pages. If any step fails, nothing is published and the old site stays up. A deploy already running is never cancelled; a newer push waits for it. It can also be started by hand from the Actions tab.

One-time setup, done by the repository owner: in GitHub open Settings, then Pages, and set Source to GitHub Actions.
